- 👋 Hi, I’m @theLittleCoder26
- 👀 I’m interested in event technology (since my childhood), sports (running, cycling and slowly also swimming -> I want to run a triathlon one day) and music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and TeX
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on audio network broadcasting projects
- 📫 How to reach me? Either you know me or you don't.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can find one defective cable out of 20 cables, but it will be the 20th cable that I check out of the 20 cables.
